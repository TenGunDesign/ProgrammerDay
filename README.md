## What is Programmer Day?

Programmer day is celebrated on the 256th day of the year, corresponding with the number of distinct values that can be represented with a typical eight-bit byte.

## So what did we do?
For this occasion we whipped up a quick little canvas animation that floats dots around a canvas and aligns some to match a given .svg image. Enjoy!
